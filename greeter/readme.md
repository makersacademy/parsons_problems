# Greeter

This program consists of one method, which takes one argument, such as "Frances", and then prints "Hello, Frances" to the screen.  It makes more sense if the string provided is a name, but it will _work_ with any string or pretty much anything else that's used!

## Code

Write out these lines, in the correct order, in `./lib/greeter.rb` to implement the greeter program.

`puts "Hello, #{guest}"`

`end`

`def greeter(guest)`
