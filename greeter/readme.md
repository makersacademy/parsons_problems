# Greeter

This program consists of one method, which takes a string as an argument and then prints "Hello, <string>" to the screen.  It makes more sense if the string you provide is a name, but it will work with any string!

## Code

Write out these lines, in the correct order, in `./lib/greeter.rb` to implement the greeter program.

`puts "Hello, #{guest}"`

`end`

`def greeter(guest)`
