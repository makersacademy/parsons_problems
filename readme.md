# Parsons Problems

A Parsons Problem is a complete, though usually short, computer program where the lines are in a random order.  To solve the problem, you must re-arrange the lines of code so that the program executes, without error, and performs the intended task.

Parsons problems allow you to focus on understanding the steps that a program must take in order to perform some task, rather than on the syntax.

If you type out each line, rather than copy-pasting, you'll also build some muscle memory for the syntax.

**But remember** that you should not edit any of the lines.  Your only job is to rearrange what is already there.

## An example
* Create a new file called add.rb
* Add these three lines of code to your new file, one by one, in the correct order
* Run the file by doing `ruby add.rb`
* You should see no errors
* And you should see the total printed to the terminal

`number1 + number2`

`end`

`def add(number1, number2)`

`p add(1,2)`
